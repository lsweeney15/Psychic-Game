# Homework Assignment #3:
### Psychic Game

This repository is for homework assignment #3 for University of Miami Coding Bootcamp. 

This game was built with JavaScript.

## It's hosted online here: https://lsweeney15.github.io/Psychic-Game/

## How to Play:
1. The computer will randomly choose a letter from the alphabet. The goal is for the user to guess that letter by pressing a key on the keyboard.

2. The user is allowed 9 chances to guess the correct letter. The game will display each incorrect guess the user makes.

3. The game will prevent the user from making any guesses that aren't letters a - z. The game will also prevent the user from repeating previous guesses. Neither of these mistakes will count as one of the user's 9 chances.

4. Each time the user guesses a letter correctly, they will receive a notification and their win count will increase by one. If they fail to guess the correct letter in 9 chances, their losses count will increase by one.

5. The user will receive an alert and the option to Play Again for each win or loss.

6. The game will restart without reloading the page.
